# Julia-Programming-Language
Julia is a flexible dynamic language, appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages.<br/> It allows concurrent, parallel and distributed computing, and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. <br/>You can even call Python functions by the 'PyCall' package.
